Minimum game - Collect key(s), open door, torch system, Monster stat



Door shuts in face at start
	(Low Priority: hear locking sounds)

Underwater Sewer, First Person
Have to find 3 keys in specific locations

Torches too

Monstermeter constantly increases
	Unless you have torch
Monstermeter has 25% segments,
	Only collecting keys clears meter
	Getting a torch clears current segment,
		and prevents meter increase
		Torch has time limit
			water also puts it out

More eyeballs appear as meter increases
	(Stretch Goal: Screentears, Sound events)

Monstermeter > 75% =
	apparation appears, gets closer/bigger/more visible
Monsmeter >= 100% =
	"Jumpscare"/Start over
